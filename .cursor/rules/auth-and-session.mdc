Auth is handled by next-auth under /pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts.
Use JWT strategy; use getServerSession on the server where needed and useSession() on the client.
Do not introduce custom auth frameworks unless requested.
Keep secrets out of the client; use NEXT*PUBLIC* only for safe, public values.
