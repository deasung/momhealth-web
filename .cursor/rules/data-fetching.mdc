Use axios for HTTP requests.
Prefer a single axios instance (e.g., /hooks/api.ts) for baseURL and interceptors; reuse it instead of creating new clients.
For server-side data on Pages Router, use getServerSideProps/getStaticProps as appropriate.
All async calls must use try/catch with reasonable error surfaces (no silent failures).
